I couldn't find a single cube timer app on Google Play that is:

a) not ridden with ads
b) looks nice

So I tried to make one myself! My vision was to implement the features expected of such a timer while staying true to its original purpose, including:

- Allowing for 15 seconds of inspection time as per World Cube Association competition ruling
- Generating random scrambles
- Career statistics: recent/historical averages and ability to manage previous solves
- A light/dark theme
