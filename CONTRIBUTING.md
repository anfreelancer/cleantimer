Hey! 

First off, thanks for checking out my repo. I really didn't think anyone would take the time to do that.

I'm moved that someone is even thinking of contributing code. You can probably tell at first glance of the code, but this is the first time I dabbled with mobile development. 

I expect this to be a very small-scale operation so I'm sure that we can sort things out pretty easily. 

I think it'd be good if we used the Github workflow and if not, you can shoot me a email at zugzhang@gmail.com and we can talk it out! 

You can also just send a email if you want to chat :)
